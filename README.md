## Transport & Logistics Data Analysis (Python Project)
This project explores how congestion level, distance, and weather impact affect travel time 
in transport and logistics. Using Python for data analysis and machine learning, several insights were
uncovered:

## Key Findings
1. Routes with the longest travel times had higher congestion levels.
2. No strong link was found between weather and congestion using Chi-square analysis.
3. Travel time doesn't depend directlyon congestion level (from Linear Regression).
4. Higher probabilities were related to lower congestion levels, suggesting smoother routes.
5. Skyline (1) routes were shorter and faster, while Skyline (0) routes were longer and slower.
6. Travel time prediction equations:
  -Travel Time = 0.4888 * Congestion Level + 60.698
  -Travel Time = 1.067 * Weather Impact + 60.19
   
8. Decision Tree model accuracy: 99.7%, showing distace as the most influencial factor in predicting
   congestion.
9. Shorter distances resulted in less congestion, while longer distances increased congestion probability.

## Conclusion
Distance and weather play key roles in determining travel efficiency. Machine learning models Linear Regression and 
Decision Tree Classifiers can help optimize routes and improve logistics decision-making.
